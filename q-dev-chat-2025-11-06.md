I have a capacitor application 

I want local notification 

want icon for notification 

periodic notification (every 5 mins) 

give me detailed steps (think of all the dependencies)

---

I'll help you implement local notifications with icons and periodic scheduling in your Capacitor application. Let me first check your project structure to understand the current setup.

---

Now let me check your current package.json and capacitor.config.json to understand your dependencies:

---

Perfect! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to implement local notifications with icons and periodic scheduling in your Capacitor app:

## Step 1: Install Local Notifications Plugin

---

Installing the Capacitor local notifications plugin

---

shell

---

## Step 2: Sync Capacitor

---

Syncing Capacitor to update native projects with the new plugin

---

shell

---

## Step 3: Create Notification Icon

Let me create a notification icon in the appropriate directories:

---

Creating notification icon directories for Android

---

shell

---

Copying the existing icon to use as notification icon for Android

---

shell

---

## Step 4: Update Capacitor Configuration

---

Adding local notifications configuration to capacitor.config.json

---

## Step 5: Create Notification Service

---

Creating a notification service module to handle local notifications

---

## Step 6: Update Main.js to Include Notifications

---

Updating main.js to import and initialize the notification service

---

## Step 7: Update HTML to Support ES6 Modules

---

Updating HTML to support ES6 modules and include Capacitor core

---

## Step 8: Add Android Permissions

---

Adding notification permissions to Android manifest

---

## Step 9: Create Alternative Non-Module Version (for compatibility)

Since ES6 modules might have compatibility issues, let me create a non-module version:

---

Creating a standalone notification service without ES6 modules for better compatibility

---

## Step 10: Update main.js to use standalone version

---

Updating main.js to use the standalone notification service

---

Updating main.js to use the standalone notification service

---

## Step 11: Update HTML to include standalone notification service

---

Updating HTML to include the standalone notification service and remove module type

---

## Step 12: Sync Capacitor again

---

Syncing Capacitor to apply all changes

---

shell

---


## Summary

Your Capacitor app now has local notifications with icons and periodic scheduling every 5 minutes. Here's what was implemented:

### **Dependencies Added:**
- `@capacitor/local-notifications@7.0.3`

### **Key Features:**
1. **Custom notification icon** - Uses your existing app icon as notification icon
2. **Periodic notifications** - Schedules notifications every 5 minutes for 24 hours
3. **Permission handling** - Requests notification permissions on app start
4. **Auto-renewal** - Reschedules notifications when app starts

### **Files Modified/Created:**
- `capacitor.config.json` - Added notification configuration
- `www/js/notifications-standalone.js` - Notification service
- `www/js/main.js` - Integration with main app
- `www/index.html` - Added Capacitor core and notification scripts
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added notification permissions
- `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/notification_icon.png` - Notification icon

### **How to Test:**
1. Build and run on device: `npx cap run android` or `npx cap run ios`
2. Grant notification permissions when prompted
3. Wait 5 minutes to see the first notification
4. Check notification settings to see scheduled notifications

### **Additional Features Available:**
- `notificationService.scheduleImmediateNotification(title, body)` - For instant notifications
- `notificationService.cancelPeriodicNotifications()` - To stop periodic notifications

The notifications will automatically restart when the app is opened, ensuring continuous 5-minute intervals.
